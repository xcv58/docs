}

In order to change the [default behavior of a static deployment](/docs/static-deployments/introduction-and-deploying#default-behavior) running on <Now color="#000"/>, there are configuration options that can be used within a `static` property within a `now.json` file.

## Options
Following is a list of configuration options that enable static deployments to be controlled flexibly.
- [`public` (String)](#public-(string)) - Configure a subdirectory to be served in place of the current working directory.
- [`cleanUrls` (Boolean|Array)](#cleanurls-(boolean|array)) - Strip `.html` from files in the URL.
- [`rewrites` (Array)](#rewrites-(array)) - Configure URL paths to serve specific files.
- [`redirects` (Array)](#redirects-(array)) - Forward paths to different paths or external URLs.
- [`headers` (Array)](#headers-(array)) - Set custom headers for specific paths.
- [`directoryListing` (Boolean|Array)](#directorylisting-(boolean|array)) - Disable directory listing or restrict it to certain paths.
- [`unlisted` (Array)](#unlisted-(array)) - Exclude paths from being in the directory listing.
- [`trailingSlash` (Boolean)](#trailingslash-(boolean)) - Remove or add trailing slashes to all paths.
- [`renderSingle` (Boolean)](#rendersingle-(boolean)) - If a directory only contains one file, render it

    > Note: All following descriptions of the configuration options contain usage examples which are of a complete `now.json` configuration file, but do not indicate a limit to the configuration.

### public (String)
By default, the current working directory will be served. To serve a specific path, use this option to pass a custom directory relative to the current working directory.

**Usage**:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "public": "dist"
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting the directory `./dist` as the path to serve content from, set within a `now.json` file.</Caption>

### cleanUrls (Boolean|Array)
**Default**: `true`

By default, `.html` extensions are removed from URLs.

**Usage**:<br />
To disable this feature, pass `false` as the value.
```json
{
  "static": {
    "cleanUrls": false
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of disabling the `cleanUrls` feature from within a `now.json` coniguration file.</Caption>

Restrict this feature to certain paths using the following:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "cleanUrls": [
      "/app/**"
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of restricting the `cleanUrls` feature to the `app` directory from within a `now.json` coniguration file.</Caption>

### rewrites (Array)
`rewrites` allow to serve a file under a different path than that file is under. For example, to serve a file named `edit.html` under the URL `projects/*/edit`. This will make the `edit.html` file accessible through any URL following the pattern that was configured, such as `projects/acme/edit`.

**Usage**:<br />
Using the above example, setting up a rewrite from `projects/*/edit` to server `edit.html`:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "projects/*/edit", "destination": "/edit.html" }
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of a `rewrite` setup within a `now.json` configuration file that points the path `projects/*/edit` to the `edit.html` file.</Caption>

This is very beneficial for single page applications (SPAs), where the user should be directed to the `index.html` file.
```json
{
  "static": {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "app/**", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting up the `rewrites` option to route requests from any path starting with `app/` to `/index.html`.</Caption>

Another feature of the `rewrites` option is "routing segments". When a route is requested using this method, Now can pass a particular section of that route to the file that's intended to be served. For example, to route a user from `projects/acme/edit` to `/edit-acme.html`, the following method is used:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/projects/:id/edit", "destination": "/edit-:id.html" }
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of a `rewrite` option setup that routes users from `/projects/[any ID]/edit` to the file `/edit-[any ID].html`.</Caption>

### redirects (Array)
The `redirects` option provides a method to redirect users from one path to another, or to an external URL.

**Usage**:<br />
Using the above example, setting up a rewrite from `projects/*/edit` to server `edit.html`:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "redirects": [
      { "source": "/old", "destination": "/new" }
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting up a redirect from the route `/old` to `/new`.</Caption>

By default, all redirects are carried out with the status code 301, but this behavior can be adjusted by setting the `type` property directly on the object.
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/old", "destination": "/new", "type": 302 }
  ]
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting up a redirect from the route `/old` to `/new` using the status code `302`.</Caption>

Like `rewrites`, `redirects` support "routing segments".
```
{
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/old/:id", "destination": "/new/:id" }
  ]
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting up a redirect from the route `/old/[any ID]` to `/new/[any ID]`. For example, `/old/12` would redirect to `/new/12`.</Caption>

### headers (Array)
The `headers` configuration option gives the ability to set custom headers and to overwrite the default headers.

**Usage**:<br />
For example, when using the [Now CDN](/cdn), you might want to set custom caching headers since we automatically set them for static deployments.
```json
{
  "static": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png)",
        "headers": [{
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "max-age=7200"
        }]
      }, {
        "source": "404.html",
        "headers": [{
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "max-age=300"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>An example of setting Cache-Control header for image files and the `404.html` page.</Caption>

> Note: If the ETag header is defined with this configuration option, the handler will automatically reply with status code 304 for the path if a request comes in with a matching If-None-Match header.

Another example is to use the `Accept` header to serve a different kind of content. In order to serve the contents of directories, errors, and other meta information as JSON instead of HTML, the following configuration can be used:

```json
{
  "static": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [{
          "key": "Accept",
          "value": "application/json"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### directoryListing (Boolean|Array)
For a path that is not a file but a directory, Now will automatically render a list of all the files and directories contained inside that directory.

**Usage**:<br />
This option can be disabled by passing `false` to the option from within a `now.json` configuration file.
```json
{
  "static": {
    "directoryListing": false
  }
}
```
<Caption>Disabling `directoryListing` for an app in a `now.json` configuration file.</Caption>

It can also be used to restrict listing to certain paths:
```json
{
  "static": {
    "directoryListing": [
      "/assets/**",
      "/!assets/private"
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>Enabling `directoryListing` for all directories under the `/assets/` path, but disabling it for the `/assets/private` path.</Caption>

### unlisted (Array)
To prevent listing certain files in the directory listing that Now provides, if it is enabled, use the `unlisted` property.

**Usage**:<br />
This option can be disabled by passing `false` to the option from within a `now.json` configuration file.
```json
{
  "static": {
    "unlisted": [
      ".git",
      ".DS_Store"
    ]
  }
}
```
<Caption>Configuring `unlisted` to prevent the `.git` and `.DS_Store` files from showing in directory listings.</Caption>

> Note: The above example shows the default excluded files from directory listings.

### trailingSlash (Boolean)
By default, Now tries to make assumptions for whether to add or remove trailing slashes. To explicitly enable or disable them, pass a boolean to the configuration option.

**Usage**:<br />
```json
{
  "static": {
    "trailingSlash": true
  }
}
```
<Caption>Configuring Now to add a trailing slash to paths. For example, accessing `/test` will result in a 301 redirect to `/test/`.</Caption>

### renderSingle (Boolean)
By default, if a deployment contains more than one file, Now will not render a file if it is the sole content of a directory. To enable the file to be rendered, pass `true` to the `renderSingle` property.

**Usage**:<br />
```json
{
  "static": {
    "renderSingle": true
  }
}
```
<Caption>Configuring Now to render files if they are the sole content of directories.</Caption>
