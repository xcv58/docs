&#8203;<Now color="#000"/> comes with built-in support for static deployments. It considers all projects that don't have a `Dockerfile` that launches a server, nor a `package.json`, a static deployment.

Deploying a static project is still as easy as running a single command:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want to specify a deployment as static, you can use the following configuration in your `now.json` file:
```json
{
  "type": "static"
}
```

## Default Behavior

- **Single File Rendering**: If a deployment only contains one file, Now will render that file instead of showing the directory listing, listing that file. This can be overwritten using [`renderSingle`](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#rendersingle-(boolean)).
- **Clean URLs**: Paths will have the `.html` extension stripped from them. This can be overwritten using [`cleanUrls`](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#cleanurls-(boolean|array)).
- **Default ETag Header**: Each file is served with a default ([weak](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag#Directives)) ETag header with the checksum of the file as the value. This can not be overwritten.
- **Directory Listing**: For paths that aren't files but directories (not including a default `index.html` or a single file deployment), Now will render a listing of the files contained within that directory. This can be overwritten using [`directoryListing`](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#directorylisting-(boolean|array)).
- **Default CORS Header**: Each path is served with a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with `*` as the value. This can be overwritten using [`headers`](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#headers-(array)).

### Changing the default behavior

Now is equipped with configuration options to change the default behavior listed above.
These options help your to configure Now to run your app the way you want.

Those options are as follows:
- [`public` (String)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#public-(string)) - Configure a subdirectory to be served in place of the current working directory.
- [`cleanUrls` (Boolean|Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#cleanurls-(boolean|array)) - Strip `.html` from files in the URL.
- [`rewrites` (Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#rewrites-(array)) - Configure URL paths to serve specific files.
- [`redirects` (Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#redirects-(array)) - Forward paths to different paths or external URLs.
- [`headers` (Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#headers-(array)) - Set custom headers for specific paths.
- [`directoryListing` (Boolean|Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#directorylisting-(boolean|array)) - Disable directory listing or restrict it to certain paths.
- [`unlisted` (Array)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#unlisted-(array)) - Exclude paths from being in the directory listing.
- [`trailingSlash` (Boolean)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#trailingslash-(boolean)) - Remove or add trailing slashes to all paths.
- [`renderSingle` (Boolean)](/docs/static-deployments/configuration#rendersingle-(boolean)) - If a directory only contains one file, render it

For more information and usage example for these configuration options, read the [Static Deployment Configuration documentation](/docs/static-deployments/configuration).

## Deployment Inactivity and Freezing
Deployments stay around forever if they are not removed using [the `now remove` command](/docs/clients/now-cli#cloud-commands).

Unlike [dynamic deployments](/docs/deployment-types/docker), static deployments are **never** frozen and are always **quickly accessible** by visitors.

## Developing in the Same Environment Locally
Static deployments running on <Now color="#000"/> have the same rules as [serve-handler](https://github.com/zeit/serve-handler), which is available and open to download, fork, extend, and operate locally during development by importing the module itself into an [existing server](https://github.com/zeit/serve#api) or
using its [command line interface](https://github.com/zeit/serve).

This gives the ability to preview how static apps will work, using `now.json` configuration or the same defaults, when deployed to <Now color="#000"/> without needing to deploy first, leaving no room for unexpected behavior.

## What to Read Next
There a few steps after deploying a static app that are optional but very helpful.
